# Plenty of CRUD

Plenty of CRUD is a dating app, which allows users to create multiple profiles and brose other profiles. You can then 'like' other profiles, and potentially match! Your matches are stored to view.

## Planning Story

I began planning the project with the wire frames user stories. I already had an idea of how I wanted the application to look and function. I planned the application as a 'mobile-first' application, as that would typically be where an app like this is used most.

As I was building a Single Page Application (SPA), I roughly planned out each 'page' in an HTML section. Then worked through them one-by-one. 
After creating the models for the back-end, I worked through sign in/up functionality on the front-end and integrated it with API calls to the routes on the backend. 

Once the basic CRUD commands had all been created and were functional, I tried to work through 1 feature at a time, for both frontend and backend, and then commit when it was complete. 

I have bigger plans of where I want to take this project, so it will be being improved. Starting with the listed features below.
