# Plenty of CRUD

Plenty of CRUD is a dating app that allows users to create multiple profiles and browse other profiles. Users can "like" other profiles and potentially match with them. The app keeps track of matches for users to view.

## Planning Story

I began planning the project by creating wireframes and user stories. I had a clear vision of how I wanted the application to look and function. Since this is a mobile-focused app, I designed it as a "mobile-first" application.

As a Single Page Application (SPA), I outlined each "page" as an HTML section and worked on them one by one. After creating the backend models, I implemented the sign-in/sign-up functionality on the frontend and integrated it with API calls to the backend routes.

Once the basic CRUD operations were implemented and functional, I focused on adding one feature at a time, both on the frontend and backend, and committed changes when each feature was completed.

I have plans to further improve this project. The next steps include implementing the following features:
